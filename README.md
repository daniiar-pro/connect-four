# If you felt like you learned something from this article, I'd highly encourage you to fork both replits and finish the game:

1. Create win conditions in the console version, and create a way to check if a win condition was met after each round. 
2. Don't forget to account for potential ties!

3. Apply those changes to the DOM version

4. Create an intro screen where players can input their names.

5. Create a winner screen and a "play again" function.

6. Style each cell better - instead of a number, try to render an white, red, or blue circle.depending on the state of the cell.

7. Put some paint on that house! Style the rest of the project to your liking.
